On 14 July 1981, Coontz accidentally fired a live Harpoon missile about 60 nautical miles (110 km) off St. Croix. The island was in range of the missile and it was fired toward the island, but a search by Coontz and aircraft from USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) found no debris. The US Navy concluded that the Harpoon harmlessly impacted the sea since no trace of it was ever found.on July 14, 1981, the United States Navy had experienced a much similar incident.

During an  func-tional test of the HARPOON system on board the American guided missile destroyer COONTZ stationed in the Caribbean Ocean, the ship accidentally launched a missile.

The missile immediately flew

over the horizon and disappeared. No impact or damages were ever reported.

The incident was almost immediately categorized as a human error.

McDonnell Douglas, the manufacturer of the missile system, informed the US Navy shortly after, that there was a risk of launch failures, if the procedures in the manuals were not  followed precisely.

The US incident was unknown to the Royal Danish Navy, and thereby made no changes to the standard operational procedures.
