On 6 September 1982, a Danish frigate, the HDMS Peder Skram, accidentally fired a Harpoon missile during maneuvers in the Kattegat.[1] The missile traveled 34 kilometers at low level, severing several power lines before striking some trees after which it exploded. The fireball and subsequent shock wave destroyed four unoccupied summer cottages and damaged a further 130 buildings in the immediate vicinity. No human injury was reported.
Cause
What caused this missile launch during the functional tests? - Was it technical, or was it a human error.

The Naval Material Command, who was the main responsible for the imple-mentation of the HARPOON system, immediately started an internal research to clarify possible causes.

Quite fast it was made clear, that one or several technical causes could have caused the launch. Technical problems that could also happen to the other HARPOON missile systems in the navy.


the Naval Judge Advocate could inform Commander H. G. Olsen, who had performed the functional test on board the PEDER SKRAM, that the launch was caused by one or more technical failures, as he (Olsen) could not be made responsible for.
A navy investigation into the matter initially concluded that a technical malfunction was the cause of the launch as it happened without the launch key being activated. The missile system had undergone maintenance and was in the process of being checked by an expert from the navy materiel command. He was charged with negligence and was eventually convicted. Later most charges were dropped by a second investigation. The manufacturer of the missile later paid the Danish government a compensation, which covered all the damages made by the missile.

It was therefore decided, that until further notice, all HARPOON missile system should immediately be made inoperative by disconnecting the cables to the system.
