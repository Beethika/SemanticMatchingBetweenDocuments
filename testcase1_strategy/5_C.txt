PEDER SKRAM and the sister ship HERLUF TROLLE was the largest ships of the Royal Danish Navy, and actually became the last frigates to serve the navy for a period.

PEDER SKRAM was 112 meters long and had a displacement of 2,400 tons. It was built at Helsing√∏r and commissioned on May 25, 1966.

The PEDER SKRAM Class was revolutionary in design when originally launched. The ships became the first large warships to be equip-ped with gas turbines as the primary propulsion.

The gas turbines could give the frigates a maximum speed exceeding 28 knots, or more than 52 kilometer an hour.

From June 1977 to July 1979 the PEDER SKRAM went through a moderni-zation and update, including a rearmament, turning the ship into a modern guided missile frigate.

HERLUF TROLLE had been refitted just one year ahead. The guided missile frigates were now armed with 8 HARPOON SSM missiles and a launcher for Sea Sparrow SAM missiles.

However, on September 6 the frigate only carried 4 of these missiles.

The HARPOON missile

The HARPOON was originally produced by McDonnell-Douglas in the USA, today part of the Boeing Company, and is widely used as the standard surface-to-surface missile (SSM) among the NATO countries, including Denmark.

The missile system was introduced in the Danish navy in 1979 and became the standard SSM system for the frigates.

HARPOON was also the standard SSM system for the corvettes of the NIELS JUEL Class, and the former torpedo boats of the WILLEMOES Class.

To day the system, in an updated version, is one of the modules, that can be made operational in the FLYVEFISKEN Class.

The guided missile, which is 3,8 meters long and weighting more than 500 kilograms, has a range of more than 60 nautical miles, or around 120 kilometers.

Reaching a speed of mach 0.85 (around 281 meters a second), the missile can be preprogrammed to certain altitudes and maneuvers before launch.

Normally it carries a 220 kilogram high explosive warhead.
