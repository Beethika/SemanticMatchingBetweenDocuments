The Inter-Services Intelligence (abbreviated as ISI), has been involved in running the military intelligence program in India, with one of the subsections of its Joint Intelligence Bureau (JIB) department devoted to perform various operations in India and related to them.[1] The Joint Signal Intelligence Bureau department has been also supporting Kashmiri militants in regards to communication.[1] The Joint Intelligence North section of the Joint Counter-Intelligence Bureau wing deals particularly with India.[2] In the 1950s the ISI's Covert Action Division supplied arms to insurgents in Northeast India.
About Rs. 24 million are paid out per month by the ISI, in order to fund its activities in Jammu and Kashmir.[1] Pro-Pakistani groups were reportedly favored over other militant groups.[1] Creation of six militant groups in Kashmir, which included Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), was aided by the ISI.[11][12] According to American Intelligence officials, ISI is still providing protection and help to LeT.[12] The Pakistan Army and ISI also LeT volunteers to surreptitiously penetrate from Pakistan Administrated Kashmir to Jammu and Kashmir.[13] As of 2010, the degree of control that ISI retains over LeT's operations is not known.[14] The LeT was also reported to have been directed by the ISI to widen its network in the Jammu region where a considerable section of the populace comprised Punjabis.
Zabiuddin Ansari, a Lashkar-e-Taiba militant accused for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, said that ISI and Pakistani army officials were involved in planning the attacks and had attended the meetings.[20] An Indian report, summarising intelligence gained from India's interrogation of David Headley,[21] alleged that ISI had provided support for the attacks by providing funding for reconnaissance missions in Mumbai.[22] The report included Headley's claim that Lashkar-e-Taiba's chief military commander, Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi, had close ties to the ISI.[21] He alleged that "every big action of LeT is done in close coordination with [the] ISI."[22]

In 2012 Pakistani civilian security agencies told Pakistan courts that "suspects in the Mumbai attacks case got training at various centres of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant organisation, including navigational training in Karachi" & "suspects, who allegedly participated in the attacks, were trained at the LeT training centres at Yousaf Goth in Karachi, Buttle in Mansehra, Mirpur Sakro in Thatta and Muzaffarabad"
