The Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW or RAW) is the primary foreign intelligence agency of India. It was created after the Sino-Indian War 1962 and Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 which exposed gaps in intelligence gathering undertaken by the Intelligence Bureau (which until then handled both domestic and foreign intelligence). This convinced the Government of India that a specialised, independent agency was required for foreign intelligence gathering.[1] Thus R&AW was formed in September 1968 under the guidance of its first Director, Rameshwar Nath Kao.

The primary function of R&AW is gathering foreign intelligence and counter-terrorism. In addition, it is responsible for obtaining and analysing information about foreign governments, corporations and persons to advise Indian policymakers.[2][3][4] It is also involved in the security of India's nuclear programme.[5][6] Foreign analysts have often referred to R&AW as an effective organisation and one of the primary instruments of India's national power[7] and as one of the most fearsome intelligence agencies operating in the region.[8]

Headquartered in New Delhi, R&AW's current chief is Rajinder Khanna a 1978-batch RAS cadre officer
Prior to the inception of the Research and Analysis Wing, overseas intelligence collection was primarily the responsibility of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), which was created by the British. In 1933, sensing the political turmoil in the world which eventually led to the Second World War, the Intelligence Bureau's responsibilities were increased to include the collection of intelligence along India's borders.

In 1947, after independence, Sanjeevi Pillai took over as the first Indian Director of the IB. Having been depleted of trained manpower by the exit of the British, Pillai tried to run the bureau on MI5 lines. In 1949, Pillai organised a small foreign intelligence operation, but the Indian debacle in the Sino-Indian war of 1962 showed it to be ineffective. Foreign intelligence failure during the 1962 Sino-Indian War led then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to order a dedicated foreign intelligence agency to be established.[2][4] After the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, Indian Chief of Army Staff General Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri also called for more intelligence-gathering.[2][3] Around the end of 1966 the concept of a separate foreign intelligence agency began to take concrete shape.
