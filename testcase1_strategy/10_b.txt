The Blood Money director Vishal Mahadkar was having a drink with Leena Tandon, one of his former assistant directors, when Mohit Suri walked in with a bunch of friends. Things took an ugly turn when Mohit spotted Vishal and Leena.

According to a source, the Ek Villain director walked up to the duo and made an unsavoury remark which made Leena livid. Buzz is, she threw her beer on Mohit's face. Vishal then got up from his chair and held Mohit by the collar, who hit back hard. Before anybody could blink, the two were throwing punches at each other. The fight was all set to turn bloody as the two picked up empty bottles to smash on each other's head. But the people around pulled them apart.

Confirming the incident, Vishal said: "You seem to know all the details, what else you want me to add? Jo ho gaya, so ho gaya." When contacted, Leena said: "Look, I don't remember much. All three of us were sloshed. In fact, I would rather forget it as a bad dream," she said.

Mahesh Bhatt, who has mentored both the directors, blamed alcohol for the flare-up between the two. The young men are hot-headed and known to lose their temper rather easily.

"Frankly, Mohit and Vishal fight frequently, but then they quickly make up. I think this fight will be no exception," he said.

And what about the rude comment made by Mohit which was the trigger? "I wouldn't like to comment on that.
That will tantamount to taking sides. I wasn't at the scene. So, I can't be selective in my stance," he pointed out.

This is not the first brawl for the two directors. In 2011, at Kunal Deshmukh's birthday party, Mohit had blamed Vishal for the split with his then girlfriend (now wife) Udita Goswami. The argument had quickly turned to fistfight.

Despite repeated attempts to contact him, Mohit remained unavailable for comment.
