For many years I didn't believe this day would come. For the 14 months since Governor Bredesen spared my life, I have prepared for life outside these walls," she said in a statement issued as she was leaving the complex. Tennessee's previous governor, Phil Bredesen, commuted her sentence to life in 2010. "I'm looking forward to leading a quiet, private, but productive life."

She is expected to leave prison directly to live for awhile with Pat and Eugene Williams. Pat Williams worked as a religious volunteer at the Tennessee Prison for Women and met Owens 13 years ago.

Another prison volunteer, chaplain Bonni Skipworth, met with Owens weekly.

"She was a leader in prison, a chapel worker and a wonderful influence out here," Skipworth said. "She will be missed by a lot of women here at the prison. Women were drawn to her."

Owens, now 58, was convicted in 1986 of hiring a man to kill her husband, Ron Owens. Though the details never came out in her trial, she later said that she suffered years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse at his hands.

She said that abuse and his constant cheating was what prompted her in 1984 to troll the streets of Memphis, offering $5,000 to $10,000 to anyone willing to kill her husband. Sidney Porterfield, now 68, took the job and killed him Feb. 17, 1985, with 21 blows from a tire iron. Gaile Owens and her children arrived that night to find Ron Owens bleeding and dying on their living room floor.

Porterfield remains on death row.

On Sept. 7 of this year, Owens had her first parole hearing, where, for the first time, she described the abuse she said she suffered. She said she omitted those details from the court case to spare her children.

Three weeks later -- exactly one year to the day after she was scheduled to be executed -- parole officials voted 4-2 to release her from prison.
