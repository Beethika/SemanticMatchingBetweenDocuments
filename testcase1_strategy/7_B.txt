Lenovo has decided to play safe with the design of the A6000. The phone has a regular candybar shape that is a staple feature of Android smartphones now. The A6000's utilitarian design is not necessarily a bad thing considering Lenovo has done a good job of creating nice rounded edges and restricting the thickness to 8.2mm. An added advantage is the phone's low weight of 128g, which makes it comfortable for single-handed usage. Our only gripe is with the build quality of the rear cover - it felt flimsy, and it is quite possible that the plastic will give way after prolonged use.
Lenovo has packed the latest 64-bit Snapdragon 410 SoC inside the A6000. It is a 1.2GHz quad-core processor with integrated Adreno 306 GPU. The phone has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage space. In case the 8GB space doesn't suffice, one can add up to 32GB more using a microSD card. 
The 5-inch IPS LCD screen has a resolution of 720x1280, which is the maximum one can find on budget smartphones. At first glance, the screen does look vibrant but that is mainly due to the colourful Vibe UI Android skin. We noticed that increasing the brightness caused the colours to look slightly washed out, which in turn affected sunlight legibility. The viewing angles are passable. The 294ppi density of the display means images and text look crisp. Lenovo hasn't used protective glass on the display of the A6000
In day-to-day operation, the Lenovo A6000 doesn't present any problems. The UI is smooth and opening multiple apps is a seamless experience. The performance is as good as what we've seen with great budget smartphones such as the Motorola Moto E and the Xiaomi Redmi 1S.

This is the first time we have benchmarked Qualcomm's budget 64-bit Snapdragon 410 SoC. The numbers are only slightly better than those of its predecessor, the Snapdragon 400. This phone scored 20,331 and 11,496 in the AnTuTu and Quadrant benchmarks. In 3DMark Ice Storm and GFXbench, the A6000 notched up 5,259 points and 9.4fps respectively. This indicates that the Adreno 306 GPU is not much more powerful than the Adreno 305. We tried playing Asphalt 8 and it ran fine but the graphics had to be toned down for decent performance.
