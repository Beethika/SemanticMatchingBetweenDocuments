The 2G spectrum scam involved politicians and government officials in India illegally undercharging mobile telephony companies for frequency allocation licenses, which they would then use to create 2G subscriptions for cell phones. The shortfall between the money collected and the money which the law mandated to be collected is estimated to be Rs.1,76,645 crore, as valued by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India based on 3G and BWA spectrum auction prices in 2010.  India is divided into 22 telecom zones, with 281 zonal licenses in the market. According to the telecom policy of India, when a licence is allotted to an operator, some start-up spectrum is bundled along with it. In 2008, 122 new second-generation (2G) Unified Access Service (UAS) licences were given to telecom companies at a price arrived at in 2001 and on a first-come-first-serve basis.

Zero-loss theory
Amid claims of various amounts of loss suffered by the national exchequer, Kapil Sibal, the Minister of communications & IT, claimed in 2011, that "zero loss" was caused by distributing 2G licences on first-come-first-served basis.

Quashing of 2G spectrum licences
On February 20, 2012, the Supreme Court of India delivered a judgement on a PIL directly related to the 2G spectrum scam. Declaring the allotment of spectrum as "unconstitutional and arbitrary", the court quashed all 122 licences issued in 2008 by the then minister for communications and IT, A. Raja.

The court also imposed a fine of Rs.5 crore each on Unitech Wireless, Swan telecom and Tata Teleservices and Rs.50 lakh fine on Loop Telecom, S Tel, Allianz Infratech and Sistema Shyam Tele Services Ltd.

The court further said A. Raja "wanted to favour some companies at the cost of the public exchequer" and "virtually gifted away important national asset".

Sibal's "zero loss theory" was demolished on August 3, 2012, when as per the directions of the Supreme Court, the Government of India revised the base price for 5 MHz 2G spectrum auction to Rs.14,000 crore, which roughly gives the value of spectrum to be around Rs.2,800 crore per MHz which is close to the CAG's estimate of Rs.3,350 crore per MHz.
