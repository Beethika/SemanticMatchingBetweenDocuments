Abdul Karim Telgi, the mastermind of the multi-crore counterfeiting, printed fake stamp papers worth thousands of crores of rupees using printing machines purchased illegally with the help of some conniving officials of the Central Govt.â€™s Security Printing Press (India Security Press) located in Nasik. These fake stamp papers penetrated in more than 12 states through a widespread network of vendors who sold the counterfeits without any fear and earned hefty commissions.

The scam broke in late 90s and the Special Investigation Team was assigned the probe job. The investigations led the SIT to the kingpin Telgi and his partners in crime which largely included policemen and high ranking police officials, politicians and govt. officials. In one of the sensational disclosures during a Narco test in Bangalore, Telgi named the then NCP (National Congress Party) leader Sharad Pawar and former Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal (NCP) to be involved in the scam and that he paid money to them. However, the allegations made by Telgi were refuted by both the politicians.

Some serious concerns and questions were also raised against SM Krishna Govt. of Karnataka (who appointed SIT to investigate the case), as to why such sensitive economic crime with inter-state ramifications was only handed over to SIT and not entrusted to specialized agencies like CBI for investigation.
