The DRDO 155 mm artillery gun project was started by India since there are delays associated with the procurement of artillery guns due to issues of corruption and irregularities. Many of the companies that bid for the contract are either blacklisted for utilizing unfair means to gain the contract leading to single vendor issues and guns not meeting the requirement of the Indian Army. The artillery guns were not procured after the Bofors scandal. Hence it was planned to replace the older guns with a modern indigenously developed 155mm artillery gun.[3] DRDO along with private companies including L&T, Bharat forge are developing a 155 mm artillery gun, that is to be handed over to the Indian Army for trials in 2013.[4]

In a presentation made to defence minister A K Antony, the Army informed DRDO that it would place orders for over 140 howitzers after the artillery guns are field tested. DRDOâ€™s Pune-based Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) is the lead research agency to develop the 155mm 52 calibre indigenous howitzer for the Army.
