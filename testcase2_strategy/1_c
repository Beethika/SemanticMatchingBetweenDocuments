Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Hrithik Roshan have reacted strongly to Salman Khan’s criticism of Guzaarish

At an event last week, Khan reportedly mocked the film’s poor box office takings and insinuated that Bhansali was exploiting disabled people.

Guzaarish director Bhansali then retorted: "If such an old and trusted friend can be so insensitive I don’t want anything to do with the entertainment industry."

Hrithik Roshan, who said he has always looked up to Khan as a hero and someone he admired, added that Khan’s actions had been cowardly.

"It’s not heroic to laugh or make fun of a filmmaker just because his box office collections are not up there with yours," he said.

However Roshan said that he blamed a momentary lapse in judgement for Khan’s comments and had already forgiven him.
