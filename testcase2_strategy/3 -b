Honda has expanded its driver’s-side airbag recall again to include more 2001 Accord, 2004 Civic, and 2008 Pilot models that were incorrectly identified by VIN when matched to Takata production records, the company said. An additional 104,871 cars are included and owners will be notified at a later date. Honda, which has recalled the most cars out of all 10 manufacturers, has recalled about 5.5 million vehicles for driver and passenger airbags in the U.S. since the recalls were first announced in April 2013.

The question now is: How many owners will bother to take their cars in?

According to a new survey, a surprising number of Americans evidently don’t mind the idea of metal shrapnel cutting into their faces. Automotive News reports that just 12 percent of all cars recalled for faulty Takata airbags in the U.S. have been repaired, which means about 15 million people are still driving around with a potentially lethal airbag. AN says that in Japan, 70 percent of the 3 million cars under recall have been repaired, owing to that country’s “notoriously fastidious consumers” and tighter inspection requirements.

It’s a free fix, people. Get it done.

Earlier this month, Honda backed a bill that would require all car owners to complete open recalls in order to renew their registrations. Additionally, Honda recently launched a national advertising campaign in the U.S. with full-page newspaper ads and 30-second radio spots encouraging Honda and Acura owners to get their cars repaired. Parts are readily available now, but most owners across all of the 15 affected brands have apparently decided it’s not worth the trouble.

Except it is. Here’s one example of a two-inch fragment ejected by a faulty Takata airbag last August in a 2007 Mustang:
