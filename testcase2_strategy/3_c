Honda is a well-known company that is a leader in the automobile industry. They have a reputation for being the best of the best when it comes to safety, reliability, and value. People who buy Hondas often say that they are confident with their purchase because they are not worried that their new car will be made without care and attention; they believe that they will not have to spend much money on repairs since the cars are known for being so well made. Buyers also have reported that they are happy with their decision to buy a Honda because the re-sale values are so good for Hondas since their durability over time is strong. Not only does Honda have the reputation for making high-quality machinery, but their vehicles are also cited as some of the most attractive mid-priced automobiles on the market. Their vehicles have sleek and stylish lines and curves. From coupe to sedan, from hatch-back to C-RV, Honda truly has been able to make their presence and excellence known amongst consumers. However, when something seems too good to be true, it usually is - so are Honda cars really better than vehicles made by other manufacturer's, or is it all just hype?

Crash-test ratings are one of the most tangible determinates of a car's quality, strength, and durability. The Honda Accord, models from 2003 to 2005, ranked good (the highest possible rating) in all areas of the 40 mph frontal crash test.
