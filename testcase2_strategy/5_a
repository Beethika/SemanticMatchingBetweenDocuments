Crude oil prices took a roller coaster ride dipping down to a six-year low of $42.17 per barrel before bouncing back up and closing the day at $44.66 per barrel.

But one expert on the Eagle Ford shale said conditions are ripe for oil prices to drop even further before they can climb back up and stabilize.

University of Texas at San Antonio Economics Professor Thomas Tunstall said the price drop is due to a glut in global oil supplies, lower global demand and record high inventory.
The United States is producing high levels of crude from its shale oil fields, including the Eagle Ford region just south of San Antonio.

U.S. Energy Information Agency released a Wednesday morning report revealing that oil inventories are at record high levels in the United States.

Commercial crude oil inventories in the United States increased by 9.6 million barrels from the previous week, the report states.

At 458.5 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are at the highest level for this time of year in at least the last 80 years.

Although the active rig count has fallen and oil prices are low, production from existing wells in the United States remains high.

Tunstall said it may take up to a year before production and demand can create an equilibrium.

In the meantime, Tunstall said the conditions are right for crude oil to drop to as low as $35 per barrel before they can rise again.

Tunstall said companies in the Eagle Ford are continuing their operations but feeling the sting of lower prices.

"Down in the Eagle Ford, the restaurants are still packed but now, you can get a seat, before you had to wait," Tunstall said.
